# 3 main features of the BELIVVR XRCloud

## 1. Global standard technology : WebXR
- The development of information services is based on the Web, and the Metaverse is based on the global standard WebXR.
- WebXR, a global standard technology, can be expanded continuously under a systematic development process.


|Details|Game engine technology|WebXR technology|
|---|---|---|
|Standardization|Non-standard or OpenXR|W3C's Global Standards|
|Development method|Difficulty in applying standard processes developed and streamed by studio unit. specialize in component production and content production|Separation of models and views makes it easy to separate the organization and apply standard processes for planning, development, distribution, and QA SW development, specializing in service development.|
|Update|Store-dependent and difficult to distribute.|Real-time partial distribution is possible|
|Search|impossibility|SEO provision|
|development language|C#(Unity), C+(Unreal), Java(android native)|Javascript, HTML/CSS|
|license fee|Different according to development tools and corporate sales range|For free|
|legacy system interworking|Development of additional functions and Rpc corresponding to legacy APIs is required.|RestAPI, XML Easy to Apply as Existing Legacy API|
|Performance|High HW specification requirements|regardless of low specification <br/> Ex. Chromebook of Celeron level, Whalebook works well.|
|Developer Supply Difficulty|SDK acquisition and XR development of simultaneous processing High hurdles and for existing businesses Difficulty adapting to SW developers|the level at which new web developers are available Low hurdles, easy to develop and supply Easy adaptation to existing enterprise software developers|
|Multi-platform (XR)|need to develop functions for individual controls|support for basic multi-platform control functions|
|Backward compatibility|Frequent version conflicts in SDK and low backward compatibility|Fully guaranteed backward compatibility with web standards|
|graphic quality|relatively high|relatively low (Avoid effects such as ray tracing and particles)|
|XR new technology applied|Fast / Oculus Fastest Support for Unity|Slow / Reflecting the latest technology based on standards with the goal of scalability is a bit late|
|Global competitiveness|The Unity engine is developed overseas and is inevitably dependent on the Unity engine.|With open source and global web standard activities, global competitiveness and influence can be secured depending on contributions and activities|
|General review|Suitable for metaverse of experiential content such as games|Ideal for general service purposes such as enterprise environments, training, and webinars|
